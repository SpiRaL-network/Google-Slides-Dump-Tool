GOOGLE SLIDES DUMP TOOL - BY SPIRAL

ALWAYS USE THESE SCRIPTS FOR YOUR OWN PERSONNAL GOOGLE SLIDES ! 

I DO NOT SUPPORT PIRACY AT ALL.

Requirements: 

-Administrative rights

-Set-ExecutionPolicy -Bypass (re-set it to 'Restricted' after use)

-Python 3 is required to run the img-2-pdf.py / img-2-docx.py script

Usage:

1 – Run screenshot-recorder.ps1 
    (cd into the folder containing the script, then run it from there.)
	
    1.1 Enter the number of pages your Google Slides presentation contains.
	
    1.2 You will then have 5 seconds to focus the Google Slides window (in Present mode) before the capture begins.
	
	1.3 Select output format .PDF/.DOCX or both.

2 – When all captures are complete, you will be prompted to enter a name for the output PDF/DOCX file.

3 – Enjoy your full PDF dump of the presentation!

PS:

- Sometimes the script may capture 1–2 extra slides, or you may have entered a higher slide count than your presentation actually contains.  
  You can manually delete the unwanted images from the "captures" folder and run img-2-pdf.py or img-2-docx again to generate a new PDF/DOCX named "result.pdf/docx".  
  Rename it as you wish afterward.
  
- You can adjust the delay between captures inside the .ps1 script (default: 1200 ms) to avoid double screenshots.
